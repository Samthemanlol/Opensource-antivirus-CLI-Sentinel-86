ok so to you this, you basically have to have python installed, sudo apt install python3 for debian and ubuntu, in the same dir that you have extracted linux.py and malware.txt in the terminal type: python3 linux.py (directory to scan [ "/" dir is all dir for linux and C: for windows.] ) malware.txt and it will scan for viruses in that dir. keep in mind althugh i made this on linux most virsuses are for windows. watch the video for a better demonstration.
